# Bank-Note-Authentication

#### This is a simple bank note predictor app, which can predict whether a bank note is real or fake using its variance, skewness, kurtosis and entropy values
### I've created a simple backend api using the famous FastAPI framework, which can be used easily using the OpenAPI and Swagger UI.
### I've also a created a minimalistic web-app using streamlit that provides a basic front-end structure to the web-app.
